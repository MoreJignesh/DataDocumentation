# DataDocumentation
Objective it to create simple descriptions on the data sets, systems, and architectures to help others understand and use them effectively. 
This includes providing sample data, explanations of data structures, and descriptions of how different components interact within the system. 
Good documentation will help to quickly grasp the purpose, usage, and design of the data and architecture, making it easier for them to work with it and maintain it in the future.
